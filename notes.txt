GenAI vs AgenticAI:
    - GenAI focuses on creating content, AgenticAI is about solving a goal
    - GenAI is reactive (human needed), AgenticAI is proactive (very minimal HIL)
    - GenAI is a building block of AgenticAIddd

AgenticAI:
    - Type of AI that can take up a task or goal from a user and then work toward completing it on its own, with minimal human guidance. 
    - It plans, takes action, adapts to changes and seeks help only when necessary.

Example: HR recruiter wants to hire backend engineer
    - AI understands the goal
    - proposes a plan to do solving
    - Drafts a JD on its own and asks human for review
    - and then automatically posts the job on platforms
    - monitors the job applications
    - lets say less applications, then automatically suggests HR for further steps like post boosting, ads, etc
    - after applications, then parses resume, and finds strong candidates
    - then checks the calendar for availability and schedules automatically the intrview
    - on day of intrview reminds HR about it, and mails a list of interview questions for the role
    - after successul rounds, it drafts an offer letter, asks HR for review and sends to the candidate
 
Key characteristics:
    - Autonomous: make decisions and tak actions on its own without HIL.
        Autonomy can be controlled with permission scope, HIL, Override controls, guardrails
        Autonomy is dangerous, it may hallucinate and give wrong info
    - Goal- Oriented: AI system operates with a persistent objective in mind and continuously direct its action to acheieve its objective.
        Goal can be with constraints
        Goal are stores in the core memory
        Goals can be altered
    - planning: agent's ability to break down a high level goal into a structured sequence if actions, decide the best path
        planning is iterative, it can revisit a step if the next step is not feasible.
        3 steps:
            - Generating multiple plans
            - Evaluating wach plan on efficiency, tool availability, cost, risk, etc
            - seelect the best plan with HIL or a pre-programmed policy
    - reasoning: A cognitive process through which an AgenticAI interprets info, draws conclusions and make decisions, both while planning ahead and executing. 
    - adaptibility
    - context aware
